## Training and Placement Portal
Training and Placements provide a valuable experience to a person in order to grow and flourish in his career. Companies are always looking out for a suitable candidate for their tasks. Through this project we aim to provide a common platform for students at NITJ and companies visiting NITJ to make the further procedures easy, transparent and hassle free for both the parties.

The rise in global competition has prompted organizations to devise strategies to have a talented and innovative workforce to gain a competitive edge. Every company has its own requirement of a future talent pool for their industry, be it Technology, Manufacturing or any other field.
Internships or training are educational and career development opportunities in order to gain practical experience in a discipline. They are structured, short-term and task or project is done under the supervision of a mentor within define timescales. It should be meaningful to the intern and the organisation.
# The main objectives of internship training are as follows:

1.	Will expose Technical students to the industrial environment, which cannot be simulated in the classroom and hence creating competent professionals for the industry.

2.	Provide possible opportunities to learn, understand and sharpen the real time technical / managerial skills required at the job.

3.	Exposure to the current technological developments relevant to the subject area of training.

4.	Experience gained from the ‘Industrial Internship’ in classroom will be used in class- room discussions.

5.	Create conditions conducive to quest for knowledge and its applicability on the job. 

This portal will be a common platform for all the communication and decisions. Every company and student will have their login id and password. They will be able to upload their resume and fill in all the personal information on the portal. They will be able to see company details, test dates and other notifications on the portal itself. These are the basic features which we will be trying on our project

## About The Website
We are providing a web-based portal to help students for getting training and placement.
The software which is to be developed will work independently and is not to be integrated into any other larger system/software. A DBMS will be running behind the Web Server (on which the software that is to be developed will be running as web application) to manage the database of companies and employees, further details are provided later in this document. (But if passed by the college changes can be made to work with the college database.)
